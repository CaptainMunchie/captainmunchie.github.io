                                    This game is inspired by PokÃ©mon battle game genre where two character will compete with each other into a strategic battle. How is this done:

                                    Inspired by the Google Dinosaur T-Rex Game, where the T-Rex is running through the animated moving field while dodging/jumping over objects that is coming towards it. This will be by creating an background image that moves from one side to the other but duplicate itself to the other end creating an illusion of a moving background. The character animated making it look like its moving and jumping on the y-axis while implementing a collision between it and the object saying if object is in contact with the character then game over. A timer will be added saying that if timer reaches 0 and character has not collided with other objects then game is finished.
                                </p>

Collision will be added saying if the character touches the enemy then game over. Timer is also added saying that if timer reaches 0 and character has not collided with other objects then game is finished.

                                    A puzzle game will be created by breaking an image into 8 pieces and be placed in those 8 tiles where it will be considered full or true. The 9th tile will be empty or false, if the closest image is next to the empty tile, it has the option to move only when the user approved by clicking on it. The image tile will move to the empty tile and will be considered full or true. Once the tiles reaches a specific sequential number the game will be over.

                                    Inspired by flappy bird where the main character is being pushed down by gravity and it is up to the user to tap on the screen to go up for a few second before it goes down and repeat this process while avoiding the obstacle at the same time. To do this, is by making the character to constantly fall down on a y-axis and if the user press "space" key then the character will go up at a certain height for certain duration. Background will be animated to create the illusion of a moving scenery done by moving the first image from point A to point B while repeatedly adding that background next to it. Obstacles will be added for the character to avoid, this is done with collision where if the character touches the object them it will hold true where the game will be over.

                                    A dodge game will be created where moving objects will move randomly, while the user uses the arrow keys to avoid them. By using collision detection so that if the object is in contact with the character then game over. Timer will be added, once the time has reached 0, the boss will appear and move randomly. The user must click on the boss to deal damage within another set of time. This process will be repeated until all the bosses health has reached 0 then game over.
